I will clearly state my assumptions before starting.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n1. You have a basic understanding of Python programming language.\n2. You have access to a Python environment and can run Python code.\n3. You are familiar with the concept of writing a \"Hello World\" program.\n\nNow, let's proceed with writing \"Hello World\" in Python.\n\nTo write \"Hello World\" in Python, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.\n2. Type the following code into the text editor:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n1. Save the file with a.py extension, for example, \"hello\\_world.py\".\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n3. Type the following command to run the Python script:\n```bash\npython hello_world.py\n```\n1. Press Enter.\n2. The output should be:\n```\nHello World\n```\n\nThat's it! You have successfully written and run \"Hello World\" in Python.\n\n{Nothing more to clarify.}"}]
