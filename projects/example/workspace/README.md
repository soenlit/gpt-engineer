Understood, I will follow these steps to create the Snake game in Python using the MVC architecture:

1. Determine the core classes, functions, and methods needed for the game.
2. Create the entrypoint file and import any necessary modules.
3. Create separate files for each core class and import them into the entrypoint file.
4. Use markdown code block format to output the content of each file, including all code.
5. Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
6. Make sure that files contain all imports, types, and are fully functional.
7. Double check that all parts of the architecture are present in the files.

I will start by determining the core classes, functions, and methods needed for the game.
