 Sure, I understand the steps. Here is the outline of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game in Python, along with a brief comment on their purpose:

1. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake and its movements. It will have attributes such as `body` to store the snake's body parts, `head` to store the snake's head, and `direction` to store the snake's direction of movement. It will also have methods such as `move` to move the snake in a specific direction.
2. `Food` class: This class will represent the food that the snake will eat. It will have attributes such as `x` and `y` to store the food's position on the game board.
3. `GameBoard` class: This class will represent the game board on which the snake will move. It will have attributes such as `width` and `height` to store the size of the game board, and `grid` to store the game board as a 2D list of squares.
4. `Keyboard` class: This class will handle the keyboard input for the game. It will have methods such as `get_key` to get the current keyboard input.
5. `Game` class: This class will be the entry point for the game. It will have methods such as `start_game` to start the game, `update` to update the game state, and `draw` to draw the game board and the snake.
6. `Update` function: This function will be called by the `Game` class to update the game state. It will update the position of the snake and the food, and check for collisions between the snake and the walls or the food.
7. `Draw` function: This function will be called by the `Game` class to draw the game board and the snake. It will use the `GameBoard` and `Snake` classes to draw the game board and the snake's body parts.
