Here is the outline of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game in Python, along with a brief comment on their purpose:\n\n1. `Snake` class: This class will represent the snake and its movements. It will have attributes such as `body` to store the snake's body parts, `head` to store the snake's head, and `direction` to store the snake's direction of movement. It will also have methods such as `move` to move the snake in a specific direction.\n2. `Food` class: This class will represent the food that the snake will eat. It will have attributes such as `x` and `y` to store the food's position on the game board.\n3. `GameBoard` class: This class will represent the game board on which the snake will move. It will have attributes such as `width` and `height` to store the size of the game board, and `grid` to store the game board as a 2D list of squares.\n4. `Keyboard` class: This class will handle the keyboard input for the game. It will have methods such as `get_key` to get the current keyboard input.\n5. `Game` class: This class will be the entry point for the game. It will have methods such as `start_game` to start the game, `update` to update the game state, and `draw` to draw the game board and the snake.\n6. `Update` function: This function will be called by the `Game` class to update the game state. It will update the position of the snake and the food, and check for collisions between the snake and the walls or the food.\n7. `Draw` function: This function will be called by the `Game` class to draw the game board and the snake. It will use the `GameBoard` and `Snake` classes to draw the game board and the snake's body parts.\n\nHere is the content of each file, including all code, using the markdown code block format:\n\n**snake.py**\n```python\n# Snake class\nclass Snake:\n    def __init__(self, length):\n        self.body = [None] * length\n"}]
