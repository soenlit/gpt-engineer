Here's a summary of the areas that need clarification based on your instructions:\n\n* MVC components split in separate files\n* Keyboard control\n\nAnd here's a clarifying question to start:\n\n1. What is the specific keyboard control functionality that you would like to implement? For example, should the snake be able to move left, right, up, or down based on keyboard input?\n\nPlease let me know your answer, and I'll be happy to help with the next step!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Make your own assumptions and state them explicitly before starting"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Sure! Here are some assumptions I will make for the purpose of this task:\n\n1. The snake game will be implemented in a 2D grid, with the snake moving around on a rectangular game board.\n2. The snake will be able to move in four directions (up, down, left, and right) based on keyboard input.\n3. The snake will start at the center of the game board and will grow longer as it moves and eats food.\n4. The game will end when the snake collides with the walls of the game board or when the snake eats its own tail.\n5. The game will use a simple text-based interface to display the game board and the snake's movements.\n\nWith these assumptions in mind, I will proceed with the task of implementing the snake game in Python. Please let me know if any of these assumptions need to be adjusted or if there are any additional requirements for the task."}]
