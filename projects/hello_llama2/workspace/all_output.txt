 Sure, I understand the steps. Here's my approach:

Step 1: Lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

For this simple "Hello World" program, we will need the following files:

1. main.py (entrypoint)
2. hello.py (utility function to print "Hello World")

Here's a quick comment on the purpose of each file:

* main.py: This file will contain the entrypoint for the program, which will call the printHelloWorld function from the hello.py file.
* hello.py: This file will contain a utility function to print "Hello World" to the console.

Step 2: Output the content of each file including ALL code.

Here's the content of each file, following the markdown code block format:

main.py
```python
# Import the printHelloWorld function from the hello.py file
from hello import printHelloWorld

# Call the printHelloWorld function
printHelloWorld()
```
hello.py
```python
def printHelloWorld():
    # Print "Hello World" to the console
    print("Hello World")
```
Note that the code in each file is fully functional and contains all necessary imports, types, etc. The code in different files is compatible with each other.

Before finishing, I will double-check that all parts of the architecture are present in the files.

Is there anything else you would like me to add or change?
