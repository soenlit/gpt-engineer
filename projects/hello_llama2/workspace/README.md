 Sure, I understand the steps. Here's my approach:

Step 1: Lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

For this simple "Hello World" program, we will need the following files:

1. main.py (entrypoint)
2. hello.py (utility function to print "Hello World")

Here's a quick comment on the purpose of each file:

* main.py: This file will contain the entrypoint for the program, which will call the printHelloWorld function from the hello.py file.
* hello.py: This file will contain a utility function to print "Hello World" to the console.

Step 2: Output the content of each file including ALL code.

Here's the content of each file, following the markdown code block format:

main.py
