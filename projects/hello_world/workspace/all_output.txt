Understood! Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our "Hello World" program in Python, along with a brief description of their purpose:

1. `main()` - This is the entry point of the program, where the main logic is executed.
2. `print()` - This function is used to output text to the console. In this case, it will output the "Hello World" message.

Based on these core components, here is the file structure we will use:
```markdown
hello_world/
├── main.py
└── __init__.py
```
The `__init__.py` file is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package.

Now, let's start by creating the `main.py` file:
```python
# main.py

import __init__

def main():
    print("Hello World")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
In this file, we first import the `__init__` module using `import __init__`. This is necessary to make Python recognize the directory as a package.

Next, we define the `main()` function, which contains the main logic of the program. Inside this function, we use the `print()` function to output the "Hello World" message.

Finally, we use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the file is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module).

Now, let's create the `__init__.py` file:
```python
# __init__.py

pass
```
This file is empty, as we specified earlier.

Now that we have all the necessary files and code, here is the complete file structure:
```markdown
hello_world/
├── __init__.py
└── main.py
```
We can now run the program by executing the `main.py` file:
```
$ python hello_world/main.py
```
This will output the "Hello World" message to the console.
