Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our \"Hello World\" program in Python, along with a brief description of their purpose:\n\n1. `main()` - This is the entry point of the program, where the main logic is executed.\n2. `print()` - This function is used to output text to the console. In this case, it will output the \"Hello World\" message.\n\nBased on these core components, here is the file structure we will use:\n```markdown\nhello_world/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n```\nThe `__init__.py` file is an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the `main.py` file:\n```python\n# main.py\n\nimport __init__\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Hello World\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nIn this file, we first import the `__init__` module using `import __init__`. This is necessary to make Python recognize the directory as a package.\n\nNext, we define the `main()` function, which contains the main logic of the program. Inside this function, we use the `print()` function to output the \"Hello World\" message.\n\nFinally, we use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` statement to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed when the file is run directly (i.e., not imported as a module).\n\nNow, let's create the `__init__.py` file:\n```python\n# __init__.py\n\npass\n```\nThis file is empty, as we specified earlier.\n\nNow that we have all the necessary files and code, here is the complete file structure:\n```markdown\nhello_world/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n```\nWe can now run the program by executing the `main.py` file:\n```\n$ python hello_world/main.py\n```\nThis will output the \"Hello World\" message to the console."}]
